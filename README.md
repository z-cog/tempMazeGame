# tempMazeGame
this is a temporary github repo to share an executable of a simple game project.


# Controls
wasd  -  movement keys
mouse -  look
esc   -  closes the game
f     -  go to default coordinates


# Notes
Please keep the .dll file in the same folder as the executable. I can't figure out how to include it in the compilation.
